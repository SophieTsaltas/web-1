                    Lato means “Summer” in Polish, and it is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010
                    by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic. Originally conceived as part of a corporate identity for a
                    large client, the family became available for a public release when they decided to go in different
                    stylistic direction. Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities in
                    the design; to create a typeface that seems “transparent” when used in body text but also displays
                    original traits in larger size use. Classical proportions, particularly in the uppercase, give the
                    letterforms familiar harmony and elegance, and combine with a sleek treatement that feels
                    contemporary without being trendy. Semi-rounded details feel warm, while the underlying structure
                    provides stability and seriousness. “Serious but friendly, with the feeling of the Summer,” said
                    Łukasz.

                    England has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that still influence
                    teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples is the English Roundhand, which was used in
                    business and education in the 19th century. The implementation of modern cursive styles in
                    classrooms is probably the most influential development for contemporary handwriting education. They
                    draw from the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century, and the
                    work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern italic writing, based on
                    chancery models, as a new approach to teaching handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster
                    writing speed. Recently, it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in
                    England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting Association’s 2013 guide
                    to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were fully joined or semi-joined modern cursive styles.
                    Important among these are Nelson Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion
                    Richardson, and Sassoon-Williams model. Playwrite England SemiJoined is a variable font with a
                    weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

                    Danfo, a variable-axis font, is the result of a collaboration between Afrotype and Abu, a lettering
                    artist from Ojota Bus Stop. It is inspired by the cut-out shapes of vinyl sticker lettering on
                    public transportation buses in Lagos, Nigeria. This font, the first project from Afrotype, is an
                    improved version of the 2018 design, now featuring a richer character set that supports all of
                    Sub-Saharan African Latin. Danfo is the base set of a family of Danfo fonts Afrotype plans to
                    release.

                    Bona Nova is a digitisation of Bona, a cursive typeface designed in 1971 by Andrzej Heidrich — the
                    creator of Polish banknotes. Besides giving it a digital form, this project was the opportunity to
                    expand the character set, design the small caps, alternates and opentype functions for the typeface.
                    Two new versions has been created together with the original author; a Regular and a Bold, to give
                    the family a form of a classical triad.

                    Kablammo is an experimental variable font, taking inspiration from maximalist curly doodad designs
                    from the ’90s, the Memphis Design movement, as well as cartoons and toys from those eras. Kablammo
                    has one variable axis, Morph(MORF), which makes the glyphs dance. The decorative elements fly all
                    over the place, along with shifting weight and contrast. This lends itself particularly well to
                    animations. Each glyph has four primary states that be morphed between, and can be considered the
                    most stable and considered forms. Each of these are accessible as instances (styles) in font menus
                    that properly support variable fonts. This offers a quick alternative for accessing the alternate
                    forms, and can be handy if you don’t need all the variety, and in-between states of the full
                    variable font. Kablammo was designed by Vectro Type Foundry and released in 2023.

                    Sixtyfour Convergence is the COLRv1 companion of Sixtyfour a font inspired by the article Raster CRT
                    Typography by Norbert Landsteiner, and is a rework of some old pixel versions of the Commodore 64.
                    Due to this project's specificity and the fonts' historical origin, they only support a limited set
                    of glyphs.
